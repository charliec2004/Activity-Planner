MP4: Build What You Want

OVERVIEW
Our project has seven classes designed to manage and display information about outdoor activities that the user selects.
The Activity class is an abstract class defining common properties for activities. 
Camping, Hiking, and Surfing are subclasses that implement specific details and data for each activity. 
The ActivityManager class handles a collection of activities, while UserInterface and Main provide the user interface and entry point for the program.
